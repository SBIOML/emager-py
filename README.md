# emager-py

[![pdm-managed](https://img.shields.io/badge/pdm-managed-blueviolet)](https://pdm-project.org)

This repo is a library to interact with EMaGer HD-sEMG cuff as well as the EMaGer Dataset. Feel free to contribute to it!

## Setting up

### Redis

Some modules in this library depend on [_Redis_](https://redis.io/), a fast and easy-to-use in-memory DB. Notably, it is used for extremely easy client/server interactions between a remote device (usually running sampling/on-board ML) and a host workstation for visualization, model training, etc.

### PDM

The repo is made with [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/) in mind. It allows to easily create, develop, install and publish Python projects. It also handles dependency management. Let's say you want to create `my_test_project` and use `emager-py`.

First, you'd create the project directory:

```bash
mkdir my_test_project
cd my_test_project
```

Then, install PDM and run:

```bash
pdm venv create
pdm use .venv/bin/python
eval $(pdm venv activate)
pdm init # now answer the questions
# Track GitHub repo
pdm add -e "git+https://github.com/SBIOML/emager-py@main" --dev
# OR track local repo
pdm add -e file:///path/to/emager-py --dev
```

To update the dependencies: `pdm sync`

If you modify the emager-py code and want to test it you can :

```bash
cd emager-py
pdm venv create
pdm install
```

Then you can run the the files you need 


### Pip

You can install `emager-py` with `pip`:`

- From local: `python3 -m pip install -e file:///path/to/emager-py`
- From remote: `python3 -m pip install "git+https://github.com/SBIOML/emager-py@main#egg=emager-py"`

## Contributing

To contribute to this library, `git clone` it. Create a new branch and checkout it.

Then, setup a PDM environment.

To add new packages:

1. `pdm add [-G group] <package>` to add a new package. Optionally, add it to a specific group
2. `pdm sync --only-keep` to update the lock file

When finished, open a pull request into `main`.

## Repository structure

- `emager_py/` is the root of the library. The `py`Â modules in it are general-purpose modules which are almost exclusively based on `numpy`
- `dataset` contains utilities to load, inspect and export EMaGer data. It is usually the entry point to `emager-py`
- `data_processing` contains data preprocessing utilities. It is usually the next step in a pipeline after `dataset`
- `quantization` contains data quantization routines, which are especially useful for tinyML applications
- `transforms` are end-to-end data processing functions which take in raw EMaGer data and output ready-for-inference data. Usually, they take care of preprocessing and quantization if needed
- `streamers` defines an interface to simulate/support live sampling processes
- `data_generator` is used in online experiments to emulate a live sampling process, based on `streamers`
- `visualize` tools to visualize signals
- `utils` varia constants and utilities
- `finn/` contains FINN-specific routines
- `torch/` contains a lot of PyTorch utilities. For faster development, Lightning AI framework is used
